## 🧠 Why my curiosity in coding?

In high school they told us to “make a functional tool” using basic C in Visual Studio.  
But I said… nah 😅  
I followed a YouTube tutorial and made a little brick game in C#.  
I didn’t know much, but I figured it out. And I loved it 🖤
And honestly... Even now, that moment makes me proud. ()
